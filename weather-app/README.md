# run app

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Instructions/assumptions:

\*looking at the state management with useReactHook.

\*how I used material ui linear progress bar and modified it(!easyðŸ˜€).

\*folders structure and lot of separation of concerns when creating/using any component.

\*usage of useEffectCustomeHook.

\*reusage of the css stylings.

## if I had more time I would like to!

\*use Redux for global state management.

\*or probably to implement React Query libray to avoid the state management as a whole!

\*As being a full-stack developer, it was obvious to think about database and server where I can save the necessary data after fetching. However, I realized it would inlvolve too many refreshing/updating i.e in the database, then server rerunning, and finally re-rendering in the ui again. Nonethelese, it is something I would like to explore if there is any alternative solution to it which is more performant and less burden for the ui.
